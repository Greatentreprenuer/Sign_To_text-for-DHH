# Sign_To_text-for-DHH
The aim is to convert Indian Sign Language (ISL) to text in real time. We may take the video feed from a mobile or web application, and the model will identify the signs and translate them into text. This way, we will be able to understand what a person belonging to the DHH community is trying to convey.
